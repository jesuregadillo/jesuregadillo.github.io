Boxing (also known as "western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport and a martial art in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.

Although the term boxing is commonly attributed to Western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World. In global terms, "boxing" today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and sanda. Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports.

**THE RULES IN BOXING**

In professional boxing, bouts take place over 12 three minute rounds with one minute rest between rounds.

The only method of attack is punching with a clenched fist and you may not strike below the belt, in the kidneys or the back of your opponents head or neck.

You cannot use the ropes for leverage.

You cannot hit an opponent when they are down.

A boxer hit with a low blow can take five minutes to recover.

If an unintentional foul (such as a clash of heads) ends the fight before four rounds are completed this is a “no contest”, from the fifth onwards the decision goes to the judge’s cards and is either a technical decision for 
either fighter or a technical draw.

**SCORING AND WINNING**

At professional level the bouts are scored by three ringside judges using a subjective method based on which boxer they felt won each individual round. If the match is undecided by knockout, retirement or disqualification then the judges’ scorecards are used. If all three judges agree the decision is unanimous, whilst if two think one fighter won it is a split decision. If two judges mark the fight level, or one does and the other two are divided, the fight is classed as a draw.

It is, however, more common for a fight, especially at the heavier weights, to be stopped before the 12 rounds are up. A boxer is knocked out if they are floored and cannot get up within 10 seconds, whilst the referee may disqualify a fighter for certain foul play. The other method of winning is by a technical knockout or TKO. If a boxer is unwilling to continue, or is deemed unable to do so by either the referee or his corner team or medical staff then it is a TKO. This can also be awarded if a fighter is knocked down a defined number of times in a round (usually three).

The winner is either as scored by the judges if the fight goes the distance or is decided by knockout, technical knockout or disqualification, as detailed above.

In amateur bouts different methods are used, for example the referee may simply decide or ringside judges use electronic scoring to count the number of blows landed.
